# Saved Models Directory

This directory contains the trained models for the Handwritten Text Recognition project. Currently, you can see the CNN and Naive Bayes model files, but there are other models that can be generated and saved here:

- Random Forest Model
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model

These models are not included in the GitHub repository due to their large file sizes. However, you can easily generate them yourself by running the Jupyter notebook. Once you run the training cells, these models will be automatically saved in this directory.

## Available Models
1. `cnn.h5` - Convolutional Neural Network model
1. `naive_bayes.pkl` - Naive Bayes classifier model

## Models that will be generated after running the notebook
2. Random Forest Model
3. KNN Model
4. SVM Model

Note: The size of these models can be quite large due to the complexity of the EMNIST dataset and the model architectures.
